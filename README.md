# Tcet linux repo testing

This repository is for testing packages for the [Tcet Linux](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux).

The packages are first tested here and then if they are considered stable and good are then uploaded to [tcet linux repo](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux-repo) from where Tcet-linux gets its packages.
